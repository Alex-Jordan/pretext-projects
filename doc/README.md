PreTeXt Projects Documentation
==============================

The `model-project-entry.xml` file is a template you may use
for creating your project's entry.  It is heavily annotated,
and these annotations **are** the documentation.

You may remove the annotations if you prefer.  Please leave 
the copyright notice and version marker in place, and unchanged.
