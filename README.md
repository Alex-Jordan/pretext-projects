PreTeXt Projects
================

This repository is a database of projects authored and distributed
using [PreTeXt](http://pretextbook.org).  It serves several purposes:
* Raw data for generating an HTML list of all PreTeXt projects.
* Raw data for producing statistics about use of PreTeXt.
* A place to claim and record the `document-id` identifier which
will allow you to uniquely identify components of your project.

Current List:  (Link coming soon.)

Creating or Updating Your Project Entry
=======================================

* Preferred: create a pull request via this repository.
* Alternate: email Rob Beezer a new, or edited, version
of your **entire** file as an attachment using ASCII or
Unicode text.  He will replace the old version with your
new one and manage the resulting `git` commit for you.

Note that the `doc` directory of this repository has an
annotated file you can use to create the entry for your
project.  This file **is** the documentation.  So start
there, not with some other project's file.

Also, the file in the `doc` directory as the correct
version number for the XML, which will help us maintain
this data and this repository.

Plea
====

Thanks for your interest in, and use of, PreTeXt.  Having a
comprehensive and current database of existing projects helps
others -- readers, authors, publishers, and supporters -- understand
the scope and nature of the project.  That in turn results in better
software for everyone.
