    <description>
        <p>This short expository note was authored in PreTeXt early in the development of PreTeXt itself (Summer&#xa0;2013).  The LaTeX output required very few adjustments to be acceptable to the journal's editorial processes.</p>

        <p>The XML source has been updated to reflect early changes in PreTeXt, and the HTML output was last built in March&#xa0;2015.  As of early 2020 the online version seems to still be rendering just fine, a testimony to certain fundamental technical decisions.</p>
