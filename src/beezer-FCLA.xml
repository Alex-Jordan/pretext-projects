    <description>
        <p>The book that started it all, now converted to PreTeXt (its third source format).</p>
        <p>This book is aimed at mathematics majors, seeing their first course after calculus that stresses theorems and their proofs.  It contains a very thorough introduction to the use of the open source system, <a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a>, for linear algebra.  Besides an extensive collection of traditional exercises, there are also reading questions for each of the thirty-seven (daily) sections.</p>

    <onesentence>
        A textbook for an introductory linear algebra course with an algebraic approach
        that serves as a transition course for math majors, emphasizing definitions, theorems, and proofs.
