        Math Resources review introductory algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry.

    <description>
        <p>
            The materials begin with linear equations in two variables and extends through trigonometry.
            The materials can be used in various ways, particularly in online courses.
        </p>

        <p>
            The material was written with review in mind,
            but there is enough detail that it would be useful for new students as well.
            All exercises in the content areas are fully keyed, with no steps excluded.
            The supplemental problem sets only include answers; they are not fully keyed.
            While video instruction is useful for many, there are also learners who prefer written exposition,
            hence the redundancy in presentation of material.
        </p>
